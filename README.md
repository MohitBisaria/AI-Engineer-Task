In LLM_train.py file I have used a CNN daily mail dataset though it was running successful but was showing memory out of use,My system doesnot have so much ram to train so much huge amount of dataset
Then I took samsum dataset to train LLM_train.py file but it is taking too much time.
In LLM.py I have taken a pretrained model facebook/bart-large-cnn and then with the help of get and post request i have tried to give random long inputs from news or articles and it is able to summarize text  between 30 to 100 words.
I have attached the screenshot of the output which I have got from get and post request.
I have attached the link of cnn daily mail dataset from kaggle below
